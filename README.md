# Database.NET

Database.NET is a C# class library designed to provide a simple and efficient way to manage JSON flat-file databases with support for massive datasets, including operations such as adding, removing, and editing items.

## Features

- **Asynchronous File I/O:** Utilizes asynchronous file I/O operations to improve responsiveness and performance, allowing the application to continue executing other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
- **Memory Caching:** Implements memory caching to reduce disk I/O operations by keeping the data in memory and only writing to the file when necessary.
- **Batch Processing:** Supports batch processing for operations like adding, removing, or editing multiple items, reducing the number of disk I/O operations.
- **Parallelism:** Utilizes parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, such as editing multiple items concurrently, to improve performance on multi-core processors.
